Hello, and welcome to my personal website. I am actually not sure how many times you've read that by now, but I am still filling everything. I am a senior student at Bilkent university who has been blessed with a passion for both Computer Science and Mathematics. So, I double majored in both! Other than that, I enjoy working on computational biology projects in ÇiçekLab. I am interested in pursuing a career in research and academia in the future. My research interests are machine learning and computational biology. 

Hobbies
=====
In my free time, I enjoy going on aimless photography walks. If you are interested in seeing some of my work, feel free to check out my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mohahf19/) account. I also love playing table tennis! It can get really competitive, however. Other than that, I love playing chess (disclaimer: I am not so good).
